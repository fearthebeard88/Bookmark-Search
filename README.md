# Bookmark Search

This chrome extension is designed to help searching through bookmarks. Each search method looks through your bookmark titles. Currently the following  search methods are supported:
- Contains
- Equals (Exact match)
- Starts with
- Regular expression

"Contains", "Equals", and "Starts with" are all self explanatory. "Regular expression" allows you to use your own custom regular expression to search your bookmarks.

You can configure which search method you want to use in the chrome extension settings page, which can be found by going to your [Chrome Extensions](chrome://extensions) and navigating to this extension or by clicking the "gear" icon in the top of the extensions popup.

Note: This extension is still under active development and is currently incomplete. When the following tasks are complete the first release will be tagged.
